Group 4

## REQUIREMENTS
### 1. Relational Database Usage
[] The project must utilize a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL,
PostgreSQL, SQLite, or any other relational database system.
[] The database must contain at least five tables, each with appropriate relationships (e.g., primary
keys, foreign keys).
### 2. System Development
[] Develop a working system that integrates with the database and provides functionality for users to
interact with it.
[] The system must allow CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for all major entities
represented in the database.
[] The system can have any form of interface (command-line, web-based, etc.) as long as it interacts
efficiently with the database.
### 3. Data Integrity and Constraints
Ensure that the project demonstrates the use of appropriate constraints in the database:
[] Primary keys to uniquely identify records.
[] Foreign keys to maintain relationships between tables.
[] Use of not null, unique, and default values where necessary to ensure data integrity.
### 4. Queries
The project must include a set of SQL queries that demonstrate:
[] Joins between two or more tables.
[] Use of aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) and GROUP BY statements.
[] At least one example of a subquery.
[] The queries should be integrated into the system to retrieve and manipulate data.
### 5. Database Population
[] The database must be populated with realistic data, containing at least 50 records per table or
an appropriate number of records to demonstrate functionality.
### 6. GitHub Repository
[] The project must be hosted in a GitHub repository (or an equivalent version control platform).
[] The repository should contain all the necessary code, SQL scripts for creating the database schema,
and data population.
[] Ensure that the commit history shows clear evidence of contributions from each group member.
### 7. Team Collaboration
[] Each group must show evidence of collaboration by dividing tasks and making consistent
contributions to the GitHub repository.
[] The project should reflect a fair distribution of workload among group members, with clear
individual contributions in the commit logs.
### 8. Project Submission
[] The GitHub repository link.
[] Rubric for evaluating group members.
9. Presentation
[] Each group must give a presentation (10-15 minutes) to demonstrate their project, explaining the
functionality and showing how the system interacts with the database.
[] The presentation should include a demonstration of CRUD operations and queries being executed
in the system.
### 10. Evaluation Criteria
[] Peer Evaluation (5 points): Each group will be evaluated by other groups based on their project
presentation. Peer evaluations will be scored out of 5.
[] Professor’s Evaluation (15 points): The professor will evaluate the group based on their
presentation and then review the code base to ensure all project requirements are met. This
evaluation will be scored out of 15.
[] Assistant’s Evaluation (5 points): The Teaching Assistant will evaluate the group based on their
project, scoring out of 5. In the event of the TA's absence, the professor will assume responsibility
for this evaluation.
[] Weight based on Teammate Rubric: Each member of the group will be evaluated by their group
members using a detailed rubric. The rubric score will be used as a weight to adjust the group’s
total score and allocate individual marks for each member
